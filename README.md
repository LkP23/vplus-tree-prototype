# vplus-tree-prototype
Python research prototype for a V+-tree (authenticated B+ tree), built by extending a , class-based B+ tree implementation. The work focuses on insert and search operations, distinguishing leaves and internal nodes, and adding commitment-ready node fields (LPC, RPC, CP) for verifiable membership proofs.
